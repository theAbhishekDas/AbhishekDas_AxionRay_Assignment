# Axion Ray Assignment Completion

Welcome to the Axion Ray Assignment repository! This README documents the completion of all assignments for the Axion Ray project.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete set of assignments and deliverables for the Axion Ray project. The work includes detailed data analysis, systematic data tagging, and other related tasks required to address the project goals. The assignments involve rigorous cleaning, processing, and analysis of datasets to extract actionable insights and ensure high-quality data-driven decision making.

## Assignment Details

### 1. Data Tagging
- **Objective:** Systematically tag a dataset based on predefined taxonomy categories.
- **Approach:** 
  - **Root Cause Tagging:** Extract keywords from the “Cause” column and map them to specific root cause categories.
  - **Symptom Tagging:** Identify and tag complaint conditions and related components using known symptom categories.
  - **Fix Tagging:** Map repair actions described in the “Correction” column to corresponding fix categories.
- **Outcome:** Enhanced categorization provided insights into common causes like “Not Installed” and “Loose” as well as trends in customer complaints.

### 2. Data Analysis
- **Objective:** Analyze a comprehensive dataset of vehicle repairs, customer complaints, and associated costs to identify failure patterns and cost trends.
- **Process:**
  - **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, standardized text formatting, and handled outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.
  - **Exploratory Analysis:** Identified key failure types such as “Loose connections,” “Not Installed,” and “Faulty Assembly”.
  - **Trend Analysis:** Highlighted seasonal impacts, as well as variations in repair costs based on vehicle age and mileage.
  - **Cost Evaluation:** Analyzed the distribution of repair costs, emphasizing the significant contribution of labor costs.
  - **Data Gaps:** Identified issues like incomplete records and duplicate transaction IDs.
- **Outcome:** Developed a roadmap for improved maintenance scheduling and quality control measures, along with actionable recommendations for predictive maintenance and technician training.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Tagging:** Detailed categorization based on root cause, symptoms, and repair actions.
- **Robust Data Cleaning:** Standardized processes to handle missing data, formatting issues, and outliers.
- **Insightful Analysis:** Identification of key trends, cost patterns, and potential areas for process improvement.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Suggestions for implementing real-time monitoring, enhancing technician training, and refining data collection methodologies.
